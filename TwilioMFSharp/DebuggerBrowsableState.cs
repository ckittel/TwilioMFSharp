    //  DebuggerBrowsableState states are defined as follows:
    //      Never       never show this element
    //      Expanded    expansion of the class is done, so that all visible internal members are shown
    //      Collapsed   expansion of the class is not performed. Internal visible members are hidden
    //      RootHidden  The target element itself should not be shown, but should instead be
    //                  automatically expanded to have its members displayed.
    //  Default value is collapsed

    //  Please also change the code which validates DebuggerBrowsableState variable (in this file)
    //  if you change this enum.
